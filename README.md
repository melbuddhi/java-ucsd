# Basic codes in Java

These are basic implementations in Java I've done as a part of the learning process. These are not completely basic implementations like the trivial ones which
go by the lines of "Hello, World!". Although they are very important to start with Java, I think everyone has their own ways of starting out. So, maybe not refering
to this repository for code about such trivial operations is a better idea. I believe a little experimentation is all it takes to love Java.

This repository is updated as and when I continue to learn more about Java in the current course "Object Oriented Java Programming: Data Structures and Beyond" 
provided by University of California, San Diego. It's a specialization material consisting of five courses, one of which is a capstone project.

I recommend anyone who knows a tiny bit about Java and interested in learning more, to take up this course. Details regarding the same are at the bottom. 

## What codes are currently in this repository?

You'll find the following implementation in the "src" folder:

1. Selection Sort - In computer science, selection sort is an in-place comparison sorting algorithm. It has an O(n2) time complexity, which makes it inefficient 
on large lists, and generally performs worse than the similar insertion sort. 

File name: SelectionSort.java

2. Insertion Sort - Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. It is much less efficient on 
large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.

File name: InsertionSort.java

3. Java's builtin sorting method - This method can be used as a helper method for bigger problems when sorting itself is not at the core of our problem.

File name: BuiltinSort.java

## Course Details:

Before taking up this specialisation, I suggest to learn the basics of Java (although the specialisation provides enough support) like input/output, variables, 
arrays etc. for a better experience.

Most of the descriptions in README.md for these implementations are taken from Wikipedia.
